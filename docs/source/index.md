# TorchForge Documentation

**TorchForge** is a PyTorch-native library for RL post-training and agentic development. Built on the principle that **researchers should write algorithms, not infrastructure**.

```{note}
**Experimental Status:** TorchForge is currently in early development. Expect bugs, incomplete features, and API changes. Please file issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/forge) for bug reports and feature requests.
```

## Why TorchForge?

Reinforcement Learning has become essential to frontier AI - from instruction following and reasoning to complex research capabilities. But infrastructure complexity often dominates the actual research.

TorchForge lets you **express RL algorithms as naturally as pseudocode**, while powerful infrastructure handles distribution, fault tolerance, and optimization underneath.

### Core Design Principles

- **Algorithms, Not Infrastructure**: Write your RL logic without distributed systems code
- **Any Degree of Asynchrony**: From fully synchronous PPO to fully async off-policy training
- **Composable Components**: Mix and match proven frameworks (vLLM, TorchTitan) with custom logic
- **Built on Solid Foundations**: Leverages Monarch's single-controller model for simplified distributed programming

## Foundation: The Technology Stack

TorchForge is built on carefully selected, battle-tested components:

::::{grid} 1 1 2 2
:gutter: 3

:::{grid-item-card} **Monarch**
:link: https://meta-pytorch.org/monarch

Single-controller distributed programming framework that orchestrates clusters like you'd program a single machine. Provides actor meshes, fault tolerance, and RDMA-based data transfers.

**Why it matters:** Eliminates SPMD complexity, making distributed RL tractable
:::

:::{grid-item-card} **vLLM**
:link: https://docs.vllm.ai

High-throughput, memory-efficient inference engine with PagedAttention and continuous batching.

**Why it matters:** Handles policy generation efficiently at scale
:::

:::{grid-item-card} **TorchTitan**
:link: https://github.com/pytorch/torchtitan

Meta's production-grade LLM training platform with FSDP, pipeline parallelism, and tensor parallelism.

**Why it matters:** Battle-tested training infrastructure proven at scale
:::

:::{grid-item-card} **TorchStore**
:link: https://github.com/meta-pytorch/torchstore

Distributed, in-memory key-value store for PyTorch tensors built on Monarch, optimized for weight synchronization with automatic DTensor resharding.

**Why it matters:** Solves the weight transfer bottleneck in async RL

## Requirements at a Glance

Before diving in, check out {doc}`getting_started` and ensure your system meets the requirements.

## Writing RL Code

With TorchForge, your RL logic looks like pseudocode:

```python
async def generate_episode(dataloader, generator, reward, replay_buffer):
    # Sample a prompt
    prompt, target = await dataloader.sample.route()

    # Generate response
    response = await generator.generate.route(prompt)

    # Score the response
    reward_value = await reward.evaluate_response.route(
        prompt=prompt,
        response=response.text,
        target=target
    )

    # Store for training
    await replay_buffer.add.route(
        Episode(prompt_ids=response.prompt_ids,
                response_ids=response.token_ids,
                reward=reward_value)
    )
```

No retry logic, no resource management, no synchronization code - just your algorithm.
