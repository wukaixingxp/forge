# Summary: Broadcast-Based Weight Update Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to implement broadcast-based weight updates in the Forge framework, enabling efficient weight synchronization between training and inference processes without disk I/O.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `/home/kaiwu/work/kaiwu/forge/src/forge/actors/policy.py`

#### Added Import
- Added `import torch.distributed as dist` for PyTorch distributed communication

#### PolicyWorker Class Changes

**New Field:**
- `broadcast_group: dist.ProcessGroup | None = None` - Stores the process group for broadcast operations

**New Methods:**

1. **`init_broadcast_group()`** (endpoint)
   - Initializes a PyTorch distributed process group for weight broadcasting
   - Parameters:
     - `master_address`: IP address for distributed communication
     - `master_port`: Port for communication
     - `rank_offset`: Offset to add to local rank to get global rank
     - `world_size`: Total number of processes in the group
     - `backend`: PyTorch backend (default: "nccl")

2. **`update_broadcast()`** (endpoint)
   - Receives a single broadcasted parameter from the training process
   - Parameters:
     - `version`: Version number of weights
     - `param_name`: Name of parameter to update
     - `dtype`: Data type of the parameter
     - `shape`: Shape of the parameter

**Modified Methods:**

3. **`update()`** (endpoint)
   - Added `use_broadcast` parameter (default: False)
   - When `use_broadcast=True`, switches to broadcast mode instead of reading from disk
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing disk-based updates

### 2. Created Example File

**`/home/kaiwu/work/kaiwu/forge/examples/broadcast_weight_update.py`**
- Demonstrates complete usage pattern for broadcast-based weight updates
- Shows how to initialize process groups
- Provides template for broadcasting weights from training to inference

### 3. Created Documentation

**`/home/kaiwu/work/kaiwu/forge/docs/broadcast_weight_updates.md`**
- Comprehensive guide on using broadcast-based weight updates
- Architecture diagrams and workflow descriptions
- Usage examples and best practices
- Comparison between disk-based and broadcast-based approaches
- Troubleshooting guide

## Key Features

1. **Low Latency**: Direct GPU-to-GPU communication without disk I/O
2. **Backward Compatible**: Original disk-based update mechanism still works
3. **Flexible**: Can switch between disk and broadcast modes as needed
4. **Well-Documented**: Complete examples and documentation provided

## Usage Pattern

```python
# 1. Initialize broadcast group
await policy.policy_worker.init_broadcast_group.call(
    master_address="10.0.0.1",
    master_port=29500,
    rank_offset=1,
    world_size=3,  # 1 training + 2 inference workers
)

# 2. Broadcast weights from training process
for name, param in train_model.named_parameters():
    # Prepare workers to receive
    await policy.policy_worker.update_broadcast.call(
        version=1,
        param_name=name,
        dtype=param.dtype,
        shape=param.shape,
    )
    
    # Broadcast from training process (rank 0)
    dist.broadcast(param, src=0)
```

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: Eliminates disk I/O bottleneck for weight updates
2. **Real-time Updates**: Enables faster iteration in online learning scenarios
3. **Scalability**: Leverages PyTorch's efficient collective communication
4. **Flexibility**: Can be used alongside existing disk-based approach

## Inspired By

This implementation follows the pattern demonstrated in:
- `/home/kaiwu/work/kaiwu/forge/rlhf.py` (vLLM RLHF example)
- Lines 112-131: Process group initialization and weight broadcasting

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with small models first (e.g., facebook/opt-125m)
2. Verify broadcast group initialization across all workers
3. Ensure weight synchronization by comparing model outputs
4. Monitor GPU memory usage during broadcasts
5. Test error handling when processes fail during broadcast

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Automatic tensor-parallel sharding during broadcast
2. Asynchronous weight updates to avoid blocking
3. Compression for large models
4. Fallback to disk if broadcast fails
5. Multi-node cluster support

## Files Modified

1. `/home/kaiwu/work/kaiwu/forge/src/forge/actors/policy.py`

## Files Created

1. `/home/kaiwu/work/kaiwu/forge/examples/broadcast_weight_update.py`
2. `/home/kaiwu/work/kaiwu/forge/docs/broadcast_weight_updates.md`

## Compatibility

- Maintains full backward compatibility with existing code
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
- Original disk-based update mechanism remains default behavior
